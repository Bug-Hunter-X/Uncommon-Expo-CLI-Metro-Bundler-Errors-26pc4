This error typically occurs when using Expo's `start` command and involves issues with the Metro bundler, which is responsible for compiling your JavaScript code.  Sometimes, Metro gets into a state where it fails to properly resolve dependencies or encounters unexpected errors during the build process. This can manifest in cryptic messages about missing modules, despite the modules being correctly installed.
