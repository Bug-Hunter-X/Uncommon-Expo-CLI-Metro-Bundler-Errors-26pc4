The solution to these types of errors is often multifaceted and requires careful investigation.  Here's a breakdown of troubleshooting steps:

1. **Clear the Metro Bundler Cache:**
   ```bash
   expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Verify Package Installations:**
   Ensure all your dependencies are correctly installed and that there are no conflicting versions.
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm audit fix
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn upgrade-interactive --latest
   ```

3. **Check Package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock):**
   Manually examine your package files for any discrepancies or unexpected entries.  Consider removing and reinstalling packages if inconsistencies are found.

4. **Restart your machine:** A simple reboot can sometimes resolve bizarre runtime errors.

5. **Check for conflicting packages:** Search for known conflicts between packages used in your project. Use your search engine to look for solutions based on specific error messages you see.

6. **Examine the full error log:**  The complete error messages from the Metro bundler might contain clues to the root cause.  Look for specific file names, line numbers, or module names mentioned in the error output.

7. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** Create a stripped down version of your project that only includes the minimum necessary code to reproduce the issue. This can help isolate the problem and pinpoint the exact source of the error. If possible, share this with the Expo community for assistance.

8. **Update Expo CLI and SDK:** Ensure you're using the latest version of Expo CLI and your Expo SDK version is compatible.
   ```bash
   expo upgrade
   ```

By systematically applying these troubleshooting steps, you should have a better chance of resolving these ambiguous Expo CLI errors.
